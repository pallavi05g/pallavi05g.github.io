            <p>Our research showed that users were lost trying to figure out how to write queries effectively. Novice users, in particular, struggled as it meant learning a new query language. Expert users wanted the ability to group queries and perform powerful tasks at once. Even with abundant learning resources, users spent a long time figuring out how to write proper queries.</p>
            <p> As a designer, it was important to understand that the Sumo platform handled both structured and unstructured data which complicated the semantics of the query language making it a hard design problem to solve.</p>

                <h3>Query Modes</h3>
                <p>Ability to toggle between basic and advance modes for query writing catering to novice and expert users. By understanding the semantics of the query language and observing how users grouped data, the simple mode breaks down a query into four broad categories: Metric, Filter, Aggregation, Group By.</p>

                <h3>Autocomplete</h3>
                <p>Two different menus depending on whether a user is just starting with a key/value pair or picking a value after a key is selected.</p>

                <h3>Multi Action Support</h3>
                <p>Ability to get alerts, delete, and duplicate actions apart from the mode toggle. By setting up alerts, users can auto-run queries and get notified whenever there is an anamoly.</p>

                <h3>Multi Filter Support</h3>
                <p>While single filters worked for novice users who were trying to get broader insights, those debugging preferred multiple filters to narrow down issues during the troubleshooting phase.</p>

                <h3>Multi Query Support</h3>
                <p>Andre who was an expert user pointed out nuances and edge-cases that had to be addressed. For instance, Andre often leveraged multiple complex queries to get to the root cause of his bug. He wrote a second query to take in results from the first and feed it to the third.</p>
