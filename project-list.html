This Android mobile application enables users to send customized messages to groups of contacts incase the person misses answering his/her cellphone. There are high chances that users would like to send different text messages based on the person who calls them, where the user isn't able to reject the call with a text. By allowing the users to create custom groups and messages which can be preset and an intuitive user interface for custom message and group creation, this app managed to find a better use case than the traditional "reject call with a text" approach.</p>

						          <p><em><strong>When: </strong></em>MIT Media Lab Design Innovation Workshop 2013<br><em><strong>Where: </strong></em> PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore <br>
<em><strong>Mentored by: </strong></em>Daniel Leithinger and Anirudh Sharma, MIT Media Lab, Massachusetts<br><em><strong>Technologies used: </strong></em> Processing, Piezo-electric sensors<br><em><strong>Project Motivation:</strong></em><br>This tangible user interface prototype was developed over a period of 5 days in a team of 5 during the workshop. The first day of the workshop focused on identifying a problem. We walked to a near by place close to the workshop location to identify a problem that we could work upon. During this phase, meticulous notes were made for brainstorming at a later stage. The problem identification phase was followed by brainstorming and team formation phases. After the initial rounds of ideation, I met 4 team mates from backgrounds ranging from Design to Computer Science.<br>The second day of the workshop was about team collaboration, brainstorming, feasibility studies and pitching of the ideas. Other teams gave constructive feedback which were noted as a part of usability studies. This was followed by 2 days of intense rapid prototyping. We worked on a language called Processing and tinkered Arduino as well for the sake of the project. The final prototype made use of Piezo Electric sensors and worked like a charm. Right from the brainstorming to the conceptualisation phase and the final prototype creation phase, our mentors Daniel and Anirudh were a constant source of support. The workshop concluded with a project open house, where prototypes from all the tracks were showcased.<br>Amidst all the prototyping, we attended a series of talks by various folks from MIT Media Lab, where they discussed several aspects of design and programming. Amazing hosts, brilliant mentors, splendid talks, delicious food, inspiring TEDX talks, and new friends, added to the sheer marvel of the entire workshop, making it one of the most memorable experiences of my life. </p>

This project was conceptualised and originally developed as a part of Oracle ThinkQuest International Application Development Contest 2012 along with 3 other team mates. In the next iteration of the same, the project was enhanced with additional features. The idea behind this project was to tackle the paucity of healthcare services in rural India. This health care suite when installed at various kiosks in primary schools with access to computers would serve as tools for the people in that area to access healthcare information with ease.<br><strong><em>Key Features:</strong></em><br>

						          <p><strong><em>When: </em></strong>Sophomore year, R V College of Engineering<br><strong><em>Where: </em></strong> Sustainable Energy Challenge 2012(SEC 2012) organised by SELCO at Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIM-B)<br><strong><em>Project Motivation:</em></strong>Asha - Sapno Ki Jholi was born when we started discussing about the energy crisis in the city and how we could make a difference. In Hindi, "Asha" means hope and "Sapno Ki Jholi" means a cradle of dreams. This project was an effort in the direction of raising awareness about waste management. After weeks of brainstorming and ideation, we proposed a solution which was presented at Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore (IIM-B) at the Sustainable Energy Challenge by SELCO India. The notion behind Asha was to promote civic sense and environmental responsibility and foster innovative ways to inculcate the awareness about waste segregation and management solutions.<br><strong><em>Our Proposal:</em></strong>The solution that we developed comprised of the various components which would together result in an effective cost effective solution. It consisted of a user friendly application in the form of a game which would teach children about the various aspects of waste management; a fact randomiser which would deal with concepts related to civic sense, waste disposal, segregation; picture filled presentations which would cover harmful effects of dumping and inefficient waste disposal; a newsletter that would demonstrate segregation success stories, community involvement and benefits and 3R bins. The whole solution was designed keeping in mind the rural India as the target audience.

Though the current system of blood banks exists, we wanted to enhance the experience as the whole process of blood donation isn’t organized well and is cumbersome. Our system envisages an application, which allows users to sign up, locate, search, learn and share. A user, on registration, creates a profile, which notes the blood type, location and other personal details. The user can then search our database for the number of blood units requested along with the blood type. Our solution searches this query against our user database and suggests nearby people who are willing to donate. The donors are notified in case of a request, which they can accept, using a simple interface. In cases where no nearby donors are present, our application notifies the nearest blood bank. The uniqueness in our application lies in the fact that we create one unified platform for both individual users and blood banks. </p>

Our proposal revolved around live traffic updates based on location and intensity of the jam. It covered aspects such as road diversions, roadblocks due to festivities and celebrations. The solution was targeted at users who wanted to avoid possible areas of congestion. It was designed to be a crowdsourcing kind of a system where we visualized a user based input system integrated with social media integration and GPS systems, thus enabling a real-time live traffic feed. This solution could equip emergency services like fire brigades and ambulances to navigate better within the city.</p>
