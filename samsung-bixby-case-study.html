This meant understanding users needs and technology limitations in order to create a design framework that works and implement that into a fully-functioning system.<br><br>The system should be able to help with simple tasks such as setting timers or even handle complex tasks like creating a photo album of recently taken pictures on a given day and, sharing it with family and friends.</p>

            <p>As a software engineer on Samsung's Bixby team, I prototyped and implemented the context-awareness framework that enabled the voice assistant to understand natural language and maintain conversation context across multiple domains such news, weather, location, alarms, and more. In order to do so, my work involved collaborating with teams across design, strategy and engineering.</p>

It matters where you are located -- Seoul or San Francisco or Bangalore or London -- as the response may or may not be relevant for you. 
                <br><br>
                Other context-awareness factors include timezones, languages and locales that affect local info such as news, weather, restaurant reservations.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <div class="container">  
                <p>I was working on a prototype that connected different services and spun out a response that was relevant to a user. Let's look at the entity resolution mapping for the following example:</p>

            <img src="img/samsung/entity-resolution-viz.png" class="case-study-hero-image">
            <div class="container">  
                <p>There are several things at play here. This task that seems so simple for a user needs multiple applications to work together. This task needs to invoke the native Clock, Maps and Samsung Health applications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">  
                <p>While Clock is a system application, Maps and Samsung Health are cloud-based applications that need to make calls to the backend. The backend has to fetch these responses from multiple applications and then create a response and speak in a language that a user can understand. All this needs to be done in a very short period of time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">  
                <p>When all these work seamlessly, it seems magical!</p>
                <p>The right most column shows how all these entities get structured into a machine-readable format that the system can act on - creating the reminder, linking location services, monitoring activity sensors, and setting up geofence triggers.</p>
