            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Back in 2014, voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa were command-driven and forgetful. If you asked 'What's the weather?' then followed up with 'What about tomorrow?'— they'd fail. Users would get frustrated if their voice assistant didn't really answer their questions. While the simple ones worked, the complex ones failed as these assistants missed context.</p>

This meant understanding users needs and technology limitations in order to create a technical framework that works and implement that into a fully-functioning system.<br><br>The system should be able to help with simple tasks such as setting timers or even handle complex tasks like creating a photo album of recently taken pictures on a given day and, sharing it with family and friends.</p>

            <h2>Role</h2>   
            <p>As a software engineer on Samsung's Bixby team, I built the technical infrastructure to make that possible.</p>
            <p>I prototyped and implemented the context-awareness framework that enabled the voice assistant to understand natural language and maintain conversation context across multiple domains such news, weather, location, alarms, and more. In order to do so, my work involved collaborating with teams across design, strategy and engineering.</p>

                <p>There are several things at play here. This task that seems so simple for a user needs multiple applications to work together. This task needs to invoke the native Clock, Maps and Samsung Health applications.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">  
                <p>While Clock is a system application, Maps and Samsung Health are cloud-based applications that need to make calls to the backend. The backend has to fetch these responses from multiple applications and then create a response and speak in a language that a user can understand. All this needs to be done in a very short period of time.</p>

It matters where you are located -- Seoul or San Francisco or Bangalore or London -- as the response may or may not be relevant for you.

                    Other context-awareness factors include timezones, languages and locales that affect local info such as news, weather, restaurant reservations.</p>

            <h2>What I learned</h2>   
            <p>Building Bixby's context-awareness system gave me a deep understanding of conversational AI's technical constraints—latency budgets, model accuracy trade-offs, multi-domain orchestration.</p>
            <p>When I transitioned to product design, this engineering background became my superpower. I design conversations knowing exactly what's technically feasible, how much latency each interaction adds, and where ML models will struggle. This makes me a better designer for AI products.</p>
