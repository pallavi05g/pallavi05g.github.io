                        Sumo Logic is a cloud-native real-time machine data analytics platform that empowers teams around the world to make data-driven decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let’s break it down further. What exactly does this mean? Suppose, you are the Head of Operations at a huge airline company. Let us address you as <b>Kathy</b>. Your goal for the year is to expand operations in certain regions of the world. In order to do that, you would want to understand passenger traffic around the world. Sure, you might consult with PWC or one of those consulting giants, but you want to analyze your airline’s passenger traffic too. Be it how popular certain routes are during the holidays, potential new routes, trending tourism spots, offers and deals, partnerships with other 3rd-party ride-sharing companies and hotels based on your airline's historic data on a continuous basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, switching gears, if you are an engineer named <b>Andre</b>, working on these enormous systems, you need to think about infrastructure, optimizations and performance, not to forget security. Suppose your check-in infrastructure breaks down, you’re likely to be fired if you don’t handle the fire in time. You need to be able to dig into those system logs and understand which piece of code broke down the entire system. 
                    </p>
                    <br><br>

                        In both these scenarios, Sumo Logic comes into the picture. Whether you are the Head of Operations at a major airline or a site-reliability engineer, you are dealing with hundred thousand requests and terabytes or even petabytes of data on a daily basis. You would use the Sumo Logic platform to ingest data, write some queries to build dashboards and monitor your data.

                    As a <b>Product Designer</b> at Sumo Logic, I work to make your life simpler.
                    
                    In our first scenario, let us address you as <b>Kathy</b>. You have your A-game in business strategy and operations management. When you are asked to use a tool that you use occasionally to solve a critical problem, you have to write queries to gather the best insights possible. You open Sumo Logic and realise that this is going to take way longer than you expected as you don’t know where to start and how to go about writing queries that give you rich insights about your passenger traffic and other strategic questions that you have in your mind.

                <p>
                    In the second scenario, let us address you as <b>Andre</b> (one of our personas for an engineer who has mission-critical work to be done at an unearthly hour say 3.30 AM). Andre is woken up by a PagerDuty alert at this hour on a Saturday and has to rush to fix this problem. Andre has vaguely used Sumo Logic earlier, but he has no idea how to write perfect queries that will help him get to the part where he can fix a bug in his code (or maybe someone else’s). Andre is super strong-willed to solve this issue and logs into Sumo Logic only to realise that our query language is way too complicated and is not similar to other programming languages he is aware of. He is crushed.

                    Both these users are having a hard time here.  In order to address this problem at hand for thousands of Site Reliability Engineers, DevOps personnel and Product Managers, I collaborated with UX Research, Product Management and Engineering to understand and scope out the specifics of the problem.

                    1. Our query language is complex <br><br>

                        Based on Nielsen Norman's Usability Heuristics and qualitative data from our user research sessions, we were able to identify 4 major emerging themes: Simplifying complexity (Consistency and Standards), Sense of Freedom (Flexibilty and Efficiency of Use), Seamless Interaction (Recognition rather than recall), Harsh Reality (Match between system and real world). Let us look into each of these.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="subheadings">Simplifying complexity</h4>
                    <p>
                        To understand this, I started looking into the semantics of our platform's query language. For this, I did some independent research by reading our extensive documentation, talking to engineers in the organization, talking to the product managers about the product roadmap and timelines and doing some competitive research. While we have very distinct query language for logs and metrics, and the project scope was metrics, I went ahead delving deeper into that. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Talking to our internal users gave us insights into what really mattered in the query language and how people grouped data. While some users preferred simpler lanugage, others were boggled by what those categories even meant. We observed that even the order of these mattered as they resulted in different kind of queries and had serious backend implications. 
                        
                        By the end of it, we broke it down into four broad categories: Metric, Filter, Aggregation, Group By. 
                        <br><br>
                            <img class="img-responsive" width="1200" height="auto" src="/img/portfolio/SumoLogic/initial_state.png" alt="Initial State with  four categories: Metric, Filter, Aggregation, Group By">

                    <h4 class="subheadings">Sense of Freedom</h4>
                    <p>
                        Efficiency and flexibility turned out to be two sides of the same coin. Deciding the level of freedom that users should have when using a structured query builder was the core question. I analyzed the way queries were being written and learned expected user behavior after conducting informal user interviews and found that while users preferred freedom to write any kind of query, they preferred some structure. They wanted the platform to assist them as they would neither remember the syntax nor the exact values unless they used the platform frequently. This led to an entire discussion about how the autocomplete functionality should behave and the technical limitations and feasibility of the same. 
                        <br><br>

                    <h4 class="subheadings">Seamless Interaction</h4>
                    <p>
                        While the autocomplete conceptual designs gartnered a lot of interest, a lot of emphasis was put on the technical feasibility, load times (given we had to deal with dense datasets), standard IxD patterns and our project timelines. I had to rethink query level user actions to cater to both novice and expert users. Leveraging our design systems reduced development cycles and ensured a modular design approach. Having worked in the core Design Systems team, I had a broader understanding of what addition of one new component meant and its implications at the entire platform level.

                        We learned that users write more than one query and each of those can be really complex. Sometimes, users channelized results from the first query into the second and so on. Users preferred keyboard over a mouse or a trackpad for writing queries or when dealing with code. Keyboard accessibility was another important aspect that we had to take into consideration. Error handling was yet another important aspect we addressed at this point.

                                Communication makes a lot of difference and is one of the key factors in a project's success. <br><br>
                                
                                Close collaboration with other designers, researchers, product managers and engineers right from the beginning resulted in faster design iterations, gathering of richer user data and understanding deeper technical constraints.<br><br>

                                Understanding technical constraints helped design optimized interactions based on the platform's backend performance <br><br>

                                Designing for a technical audience is challenging and fun! <br><br>

                                Keeping visuals and interactions simple works in most cases <br><br>

                                Details matter!!! So does context. It always goes back to asking "What are we trying to solve here?" <br><br> 
                                
                                Helped me identify other deeper design issues that motivated me to create a framework <br><br>
