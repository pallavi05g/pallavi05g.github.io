                <p>
                    With the advent of technology, there is a widening generation gap that is observed around the world. Exposure to popular media since early formative years is changing the cultural landscape. In certain cultures, age-old storytelling that was a means of mutual bonding is no longer seen and is restricted to places of cultural interest. Due to relatively few topics in common, conversations have become non-existent between tech-challenged grandparents and folklore-challenged grandkids.

                    In order to understand this diverse demographic, I decided to conduct informal interviews with users. Based on these interviews, I was able to create personas, Aryan and Meena.

                    User research showed that though these groups were on the opposite ends of the age spectrum with diverging needs and considerable differences, they had a few similarities.

                    Kids preferred to interact with technology. Older adults such as grandparents preferred hardcover books and weren’t very familiar with technology. Older adults were keen to connect with their grandkids, nephews or nieces in a manner that doesn’t seem too forced. This user group also expressed concerns about relatively few topics in common, increasing family disconnect and fragmentation apart from the loss of family bonding time.

                        Introduces two modes - Story and Record. While <b>Story</b> mode is aimed at both kids and older folk spending time together, the <b>Record</b> allows adults to enhance shared storytime experience by recording audio snippets of stories in their own language replacing the default audio snippets.

                        Both kids and older adults really liked the fact that they could get really involved with the app and take breaks when necessary to talk about the story at a deeper level.

Older folk found it relatively simple to navigate the app and record audio snippets.

                        Kids enjoyed interacting with the story as this is not something that they do in cultural storytelling settings. Older folk expressed that they were impressed to see how engaging their folklore could get and got nostalgic how they didn't have access to such technology back in their childhood.

                        Kids really liked this concept and showed higher engagement levels with the app. Adults liked the fact that the app could personalize content to this extent.

                        Kids were given candy or appreciated when they performed a task in real-life. Taking that concept into the app worked. 
                        <br><br>    
                        Splitting a story into multiple levels and engaging them with tasks, make it a lot more easier for kids who were prone to restlessness and had short attention spans. By breaking down the story into levels similar to chapters in books, users were able to consume information at the rate that they were used to.

                        <p>
                        Adding a friendly character who walked users through the app and be a part of the stories made it exciting for kids.

                        Kids enjoyed listening to the character and earning coins by completing tasks. Some kids who were curious went on to pause a story to ask the adult engaged with them about finer details of a story. Adults found this part to be enriching as kids asking so many questions wasn't something that they had witnessed earlier.

                    From an interaction design standpoint, adding fun loading states and 404 screens reduced anxiety if the app took long times to load or it had bugs. Despite the nature of these states, kids seemed to enjoy contextual loading states or 404 screens that had a relatable character onscreen while they waited.
