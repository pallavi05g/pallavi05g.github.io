                <p>
                    "The human mind is exquisitely tailored to make sense out of the world. Give it the slightest cue and off it goes, providing explanation, rationalization, and understanding" - Don Norman. <br><br> 
                    The problem that we were challenged to solve was to design and build an interactive application or installation that creates a multi-sensory experience and we were specifically asked to think beyond the screen.

                <p>
                    Kids love exploring bright colors and textures, listening to sounds from toys and playing with their toys to their hearts' desires. Kids relate to their toys and love storytelling. Personally, I love stories and call myself a storyteller. As a Disney-Pixar fan, I decided to create Interactiveety.

                <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Problem scoping</h3>
                <p>My interpretation of the design prompt seeks to address curiosity within us, especially during our formative years. As an aunt, I wanted to create something magical and interactive for my pre-school nephews and nieces. I wanted to create an experience simply magical for them at several levels. 
                <br><br>    
                Soon, I began to ponder about magical experiences for me. Nostalgia beckoned and I decided to recreate a Disney experience. In order to create a multi-sensory experience, I used different materials that varied in color and texture. I used piezoelectric sensors that play audio when users interact with the toys.
                <br><br>
                Over the course of the project, my design evolved considerably. My primary goal was to create something interactive, colorful, fun and exciting for children. While my final deliverable manages to achieve all of these, my ideas have evolved from an interactive jigsaw puzzle to cube that takes in audio input to narrate stories to an interactive object that senses body temperature to work in specific mannerisms to the final concept of this set of interactive toys. <b>My important takeway is that as technology evolves, touchscreens might be obsolete and designing for the future needs a different thought process by itself.</b> 
                </p>
                <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Exploring the solution space</h3>
                <p>
                Interactive toys fall under a category of their own and a lot of products exist in this space. However, what is truly missing is an element of combined interactivity. In the sense, I discovered that almost every interactive toy worked in isolation and not together. I wanted to create an electronic playground of sorts for these user controlled interactive toys. <b>My passion for design, tinkering, arts, emotional intelligence, Walt Disney, interactive media, software and creativity resulted in this product.</b> I looked at Skitch toy by Disney and I wanted to create something of that sort. Inspired by Disney-Pixar's movie, Inside Out, I worked on Interactiveety. 
                <br><br>
                Inside Out personifies the five major emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust — residing in the mind of a preteen girl named Riley that work together to mentor her as well as protect her.
                <br><br>
                Interactiveety is  designed keeping in mind the very nature of emotions with the help of materials that have different textures, forms and colors. For instance, the character Disgust, has hair that is made of glittered foam and has a rough texture indicating that disgust is a negative emotion, in general. On the other hand, the character Sadness, wears a sweater made out of felt, indicating the soft and gentle nature of sadness. The character Anger is hot-headed as it is made of cardboard and covered in red foam indicating that an anger individual is hot headed but since the head is made out of cardboard, it is light indicating that a person who is angry must calm down, take things easy and not get frustrated. All these are designed keeping in mind the very nature of emotions apart from drawing from the Disney Pixar’s personification of emotions.

                <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Prototyping</h3>
                <p>The following tools were used for our project:</p>
                <p>

                    1. Paper and pen: For sketches <br>
                    2. Piezoelectric Sensors: To detect taps and identify the character that was being fiddled with <br>
                    3. Lilypad Arduino board: To read values from the sensors (Figure 2.0) <br>
                    4. Resistors, wires, solder and soldering iron <br>
                    5. Arduino: To feed signals from the piezoelectric sensors to the Processing code <br>
                    6. Processing IDE: For working prototype <br>
                    7. iMovie: To make the video <br>
                    8. Wooden toy heads, wooden spoons, colored foam sheets, colored adhesive foam sheets, colored threads, glue, felt, glitter glue, stickers, scissors, sharpies, cardboard, tissue, markers, and tape <br>
                </p>

                <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Working</h3>
                <p>Interactiveety seeks to address a couple of concepts such as <b>i) cognitive development,</b>  as it incorporates the characters that personify emotions such as Joy, Sadness, Anger and Disgust <b>ii) muscle development,</b> as it involves a user tapping on the interactive toy <b>iii) sensory development,</b> as it involves multiple senses such as touch, sound and vision and <b>iv) social development,</b> as it incorporates make-believe toys and models. Additionally, this product relies on haptics to help users understand properties of materials such as texture, composition, shape, weight and color through perception of sound and touch. For this, users will use their haptic perception along with kinesthetic sense to estimate the weight of the toy. <b>Haptic perception through manual exploration such as lateral motion, unsupported holding, pressure, static contact, enclosure and contour following allows us to learn about the characteristics of objects.</b></p>
                <br>
                <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Future Scope</h3>
                <p><b>The future version of this project would be an interactive playset where users can record their own audio that would be played when interacting with a toy. </b>Since it involves toy making, it can be used as a way to teach children how to build interactive toys instead of colorful puppets. Interactiveety can be viewed as an intermediate platform between research projects by MIT Media Lab like Scratch, a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab that helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively and Makey Makey, that allows users to connect everyday objects to computer programs. While the Lego Mindstorms that are set of kits that contain software and hardware allows users to create interactive programmable robots, soft and cardboard alternatives are left behind.</p> 
                <br><br>
                <img class="img-responsive" width="600" height="400" src="/img/portfolio/Interactiveety/interactiveety_setup.jpeg" alt="Interactiveety = Hardware + Software + Toys">
                <figcaption align="center" class="figcaptioncolour">Interactiveety = Hardware + Software + Toys</figcaption>
                <br> 
                <p>Currently, Interactiveety works by recognizing taps. Future version would involve moving these toys around could to trigger other toys to talk. In order to do this, proximity or motion detection sensors can be used. Thus, it would create a magical play-date experience for young children who are used to moving their toys around. 
                <br><br>
                Interactiveety is a product that seeks to strike a balance between physical toys and computer software, by bringing puppets to life. Interactiveety can very well be extended to create a new platform that allows users, particularly kids to learn how to add sound to their furry little teddy bears all by themselves.</p>
