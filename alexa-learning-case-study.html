            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Learning a language involves multiple facets such as reading, writing, speaking, listening. However, in order to communicate in a language, you needn't know how to read and write. Conversational learning is so different from learning how to read and write and it can be intimidating. You need to get the grammar and the pronunciation right, know sufficient vocabulary of words, frequently used phrases and expressions in real life scenarios.</p>
            <p>Although there are plenty of companies trying to solve this very problem, our research showed that language learners found existing tools to be ineffective and limiting. Our findings showed that offline tools such as language classes are expensive and inflexible. On the other hand, online tools lack situational lessons and fail to help learners to improve their pronunication and navigate real-world scenarios confidentally</p>
            <p>Learners wanted a product that gave them real-time feedback on their pronunication and navigate real-world scenarios confidentally.</p>
