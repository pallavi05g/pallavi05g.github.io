              <h1>Calligraphy</h1>
                  <p class="p-mountains-small-text">"Steve Jobs was a calligrapher!!! Is that why you ventured into that unconventional field?", this is what I hear when people listen to me talk about my penchant for calligraphy. My story with this niche art is different. It dates back to the summer of 2000; we are talking about something that happened 1.5 decades ago (as of today, when I built this site). I learnt calligraphy back then and there has been no turning back ever since. My love for this writing grew immensely, over the years and those calligraphic tool sets have remained one of my treasured possessions. In fact, I feel proud to say that my first earnings ever, came from calligraphy where I freelanced for a company's major event. Over the years, I have freelanced and volunteered for various organizations. So whenever anyone asks me that question I mentioned earlier, I proudly claim that I share a common trait with someone I immensely admire. I should say, we wouldn't have witnessed typefaces without Steve and his fascination for Calligraphy. [Stay tuned for the pic]</p>

I have always been curious about how different types of coins have come into existence over the last few years. Thanks to my parents, I have witnessed history of bygone years, when they have patiently explained the history behind the coins that they had collected. Will be back with the pictures of my treasured collection soon!</p><!-- Add a few pics of my coin collection-->
