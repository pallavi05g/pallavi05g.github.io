                    <p>During the summer of 2017, I interned as a Product Designer at Sumo Logic, a late-stage startup that offers a cloud-native machine data analytics service for log management and real-time insights. I designed and delivered three end-to-end features in the core product focusing on search, filters, permissions, alerts and reports for representing petabytes of machine-generated data. I primarily worked on context-aware interactive dashboard experience and complex data visualizations, in a cross-functional team of designers, developers and product managers.</p>

                <b>"I want to spend as little time as possible with performance monitoring tools"</b> which means "I have a lot of code work to deal with and this is not what I want to spend time on"<br><br>
                <b>"I don't want to see tables. I want to see something that doesn't need to be explained to me. I need charts and colors."</b> which means "How can I quickly and visually identify any potential issues with my system?"<br><br>
                Rethinking Sumo dashboard meant taking into consideration all these user painpoints. As Sumo users look at data that are terabytes or even possibly larger to debug a broken system or line of code or gather unique product related insights, creating an experience becomes challenging as it deals with users' existing mental models around the product.

                    <p>The project was scoped for the summer interns and I was the first ever design intern at the company. I was working with Software Engineering and Product Management interns on one of the core projects that soon became a fully-fledged project by the end of summer. As the sole designer, I was given 3 major epics. After preliminary brainstorming and business strategy sessions, the PM intern and I realised that our project scope was much wider and a lot had to be done over the summer. After a series of meetings with the Product, Design and Engineering teams, we rescoped the project and got started with it all. <b>My takeway was that being the only designer on a project has its own share of excitement and challenges. And that's what makes it super interesting!</b> By the end of the summer internship, I had delivered three major features with two of them in the beta version of the product release.

                    <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Critical Design Questions</h3>
                    <p>Since the product deals with petabytes of log data, with trillion records and data from a plethora of sources, creating a unified experience becomes a challenge. Some of the questions that I had to address included:<br><br>
                    <b>How to represent different types of data? What are users' expectations for different types of data? <br><br>
                    What should be the default behavior across datatypes? How is this change going to effect users' existing mental models? Are the new features discoverable? <br><br>
                    How should a user navigate to search page? Should we run parallel queries and present a subset of data? <br><br>
                    How will a user react when using this product at 4 AM in the morning when their entire system goes down?</b>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Process</h3>
                    <p>We followed an agile design methodology with constant iterations and feedback during the sprints. One of the feature that I was supposed to work on raised broader questions about dashboard redesign and that involved a lot more stakeholders. After day-long product strategy meetings and design critique sessions, the project scope widened as serious questions about discoverability were raised.  
                    <br><br>
                    My work involved brainstorming, competitor analysis, creating user stories and task flows, taking design decisions backed by research and design principles, prototyping and testing, shipping designs and future concept testing. <b>I have to say that it is exciting to be a part of the end-to-end flow in the product development lifecycle, especially as an intern.</b> Throughout my internship, my team was extremely supportive and gave feedback during the design critique sessions. We conducted 6 user testing sessions including both internal and external customers. I used tools like Sketch and Invision for prototyping and for micro-interactions, I used Framer.js. <b>"That's exactly what I have been waiting for!!!". As a designer, it is gratifying to see users extremely happy with your designs when it satisfies their needs.</b>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="page-header project-headings">Apart from my core project</h3>
                    <p>I was involved in the concept design for a product feature and User Experience Paloozas (design swarms spanning 2 to 5 days where the entire UX team sits down together to solve one specific problem within a larger project, either at the workplace itself or a remote place). During my time at Sumo, I have been a part of 2 UX Paloozas (one in Palo Alto and the other in San Francisco) each focusing on two different projects. For these design swarm sessions, the team invites developers and product managers to ensure things move faster.<br><br>
                    <b>During the course of 13 weeks, I understood how design works in a fast-paced startup in the enterprise world. I have learnt that creating designs that represent petabytes of machine-data for varying user expectations and different types of data needs a whole different thought process.</b> I thank the design, product and engineering teams for their support and making it an extremely fun and productive summer!</p>
