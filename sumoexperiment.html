                    Let’s break it down further. What exactly does this mean? <br><br>Suppose, you are the Head of Operations at a huge airline company. Let us address you as <b>Kathy</b>. Your goal for the year is to expand operations in certain regions of the world. In order to do that, you would want to understand passenger traffic around the world. Sure, you might consult with one of those consulting giants, but you want to analyze your airline’s passenger traffic too. Be it how popular certain routes are during the holidays, potential new routes, trending tourism spots, offers and deals, partnerships with other 3rd-party ride-sharing companies and hotels based on your airline's historic data on a continuous basis. </p>
                    <p>Alternatively, if you are an engineer named <b>Andre</b>, working on these enormous systems, you need to think about infrastructure, optimizations and performance, not to forget security. Suppose your check-in infrastructure breaks down, you need to be able to dig into those system logs and understand which piece of code broke down the entire system. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In both these scenarios, Sumo Logic comes into the picture. Whether you are the Head of Operations at a major airline or a site-reliability engineer, you are dealing with hundred thousand requests and terabytes or even petabytes of data on a daily basis. You would use the Sumo Logic platform to ingest data, write some queries to build dashboards and monitor your data.

            <p><br>
                As a <b>Product Designer</b> at Sumo Logic, I work to make your life simpler.

                In the first scenario, as <b>Kathy</b>, you have your A-game in business strategy and operations management. You are trying to figure out what new routes to introduce based on trending tourism spots, social media tags and your airline's passenger traffic during certain times of the year. You open Sumo Logic and you don't know how to write queries to solve this problem. You can ask <b>Melinda</b>, your system adminstrator who has set up custom dashboards for help but she is out on a vacation and can't be contacted.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second scenario, as <b>Andre</b>, you are woken up by a PagerDuty alert at 3.30 AM on a Saturday saying that your check-in infrastructure is down on a national holiday in the United States. You live all the way in India and you have to rush to fix this problem. You have vaguely used Sumo Logic earlier, but you have no idea how to write perfect queries that will help you get back the system online quickly.

                In both the above scenarios, <b>Kathy</b> and <b>Andre</b> are having a hard time using Sumo Logic effectively. In order to address this problem at hand for thousands of Site Reliability Engineers, DevOps personnel and Product Managers, I collaborated with UX Research, Product Management and Engineering to understand and scope out the specifics of the problem.

                    3. We handle both structured and unstructured data that complicates the semantics of the query language <br><br>
                    4. Query language needs to be simplified  <br><br>
                    5. Users write generic queries that fetch all results as they cannot understand how to write queries <br><br>
                    6. We process a lot of data (think in petabytes) <br><br>
                    7. Our users tend to write multiple queries at once to get insights about their complex problems<br><br>

            <h3 class="project-headings">Design Specifics</h3>
            <p><br>
                Based on Nielsen Norman's Usability Heuristics and qualitative data from our user research sessions, we were able to identify 4 major emerging themes: <b>Simplifying complexity</b> (Consistency and Standards), <b>Sense of Freedom</b> (Flexibilty and Efficiency of Use), <b>Seamless Interaction</b> (Recognition rather than recall), <b>Harsh Reality</b> (Match between system and real world). Let us look into each of these.
            </p>
            <h4 class="subheadings">Simplifying complexity</h4>
            <p>
                Both <b>Kathy</b> and <b>Andre</b> found it hard to write queries during critical times. In order to simplify the query language, I started looking into the semantics of the platform's query language. For this, I did some independent research by reading our extensive documentation, talking to engineers in the organization, talking to the product managers about the product roadmap and timelines and doing some competitive research. While we have very distinct query language for logs and metrics, and the project scope was metrics, I went ahead delving deeper into that. 
            </p>
                <br><br>

                    <figcaption align="center" class="figcaptioncolour">Design Concept Iterations</figcaption>
                <br><br> 
            <p>
                Talking to our internal users gave us insights into what really mattered in the query language and how people grouped data. While some users preferred simpler lanugage, others were boggled by what those categories even meant. We observed that even the order of these mattered as they resulted in different kind of queries and had serious backend implications. 

                By the end of it, we broke it down into four broad categories: <b>Metric, Filter, Aggregation, Group By. </b>
                <br><br>
                    <img class="img-responsive" width="1200" height="auto" src="/img/portfolio/SumoLogic/initial_state.png" alt="Initial State with  four categories: Metric, Filter, Aggregation, Group By">
                    <figcaption align="center" class="figcaptioncolour">Initial State with four categories: Metric, Filter, Aggregation, Group By </figcaption>
                <br><br>
            </p>
            <h4 class="subheadings">Sense of Freedom</h4>
            <p>
                When we spoke to our users who were like Kathy or Andre, we found that neither knew what to start typing. It was clear that we needed to have an autocomplete component that handles their unique cases. <b>Kathy</b> preferred location names such as <b>New York, Chicago or San Francisco</b>. Meanwhile, <b>Andre</b> wanted to gather insights about <b>us-east and us-west</b>. My challenge was to create a product that handled both their usecases.
                <br><br>
                Through informal interviews and query writing observations, we found that users wanted the freedom to write any kind of query and still have some structure. They wanted the platform to assist them as they would neither remember the syntax nor the exact values, unless they used the platform frequently. This led to an entire discussion about how the autocomplete functionality should behave and the technical limitations and feasibility of the same. Deciding the level of freedom that users should have when using a structured query builder was the core question. 
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
            </p>    
            <h4 class="subheadings">Seamless Interaction</h4>
            <p>
                Both <b>Kathy</b> and <b>Andre</b> had critical problems to solve and had strict timelines. It was crazier for <b>Andre</b> as he had to handle mission-critical work at an unearthly hour. Both of them expected quick results and smooth interactions without any embellishments.
                <br><br>
                While the autocomplete conceptual designs gartnered a lot of interest, a lot of emphasis was put on the technical feasibility, load times (given we had to deal with dense datasets), standard IxD patterns and our project timelines. I had to rethink query-level user actions to cater to both novice and expert users. 
                <br><br>
                Leveraging the Design System reduced development cycles and ensured a modular design approach. Having worked in the core Design Systems team, I had a broader understanding of the addition of new components and their implications at the entire platform level.

            <h4 class="subheadings">Harsh Reality</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Kathy</b> and <b>Andre</b> were users who leveraged multiple queries to solve their respective problems. We learned that each of those queries could be really complex. Sometimes, users channelized results from the first query into the second and so on. Infact, <b>Andre</b> preferred keyboard over a mouse or a trackpad for writing queries or when dealing with code. Keyboard accessibility was another important aspect that we had to take into consideration. Error handling was yet another important aspect we addressed at this point.

                    With the help of the new structured query builder, <b>Kathy</b> was able to successfully figure out new routes that had to be introduced based on trending tourism spots, social media tags and her airline's passenger traffic during various times of the year. In fact, she was able to create dashboards that gave her rich information at an international scale. 
                    <br><br>
