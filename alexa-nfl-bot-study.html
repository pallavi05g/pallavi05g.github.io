            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Since launching in November 2014, Alexa has expanded dramatically from a basic proof-of-concept to millions of deployed devices. Early versions supported only fundamental voice commands: music playback, weather updates, alarms, and simple factual queries. <br><br>


            The system required users to learn rigid command structures and specific phrasing, as it lacked natural language processing capabilities, context awareness, and multi-turn conversation abilities. Every interaction required the wake word "Alexa”, creating an unnatural, command-driven communication style rather than conversational dialogue. Additionally, low user engagement with the Alexa app highlighted the need for more intuitive interaction methods, driving Amazon's investment in advanced conversational AI capabilities.</p>
